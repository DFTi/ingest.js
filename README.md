This project is my 2nd attempt ([first attempt](https://github.com/DFTi/ocelot)) to learn more about reliable transport using web technology. Unlike the first attempt, which used NodeWebkit on both ends and used the node.js filesystem APIs, this one uses HTML5 File API on the client-side and the node.js filesystem API on the server side.

The project is far from finished, and is mostly experimental, for an actual solution look into https://github.com/23/resumable.js or https://github.com/tus/tus-jquery-client instead. Thanks
